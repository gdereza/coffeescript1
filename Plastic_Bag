    <h1><font size="10" color="green">Should we pay for plastic bags?</font></h1>
     <p>People should pay for the plastic bags they use for their shopping. According to experts from Clean Up Austrilia, Austrilians use over six billion plastic bags a year and many of these are used for carrying shopping home from supermarkets. Making people pay for these plastic bags would encourage them to use reuseable bags. 
    <p>
  
    <p>Some plastic bags can last in the environment for up too 1000 years before they disintegrate (break down). Plastic bags are harmful to wildlife as they can kill animals, especially in the ocean.   
    </p>
    
    <p>Also, when plastic bags are made, dangerous gases are released that pollute the atmosphere. If we use fewer plastic bags there would be less air pollution, as well as less land and water pollution.   
    </p>

    <p>We need to reduce the number of plastic bags in the environment. Making people pay will help to stop them using plastic bags and force them to use reusable bags for their shopping!
